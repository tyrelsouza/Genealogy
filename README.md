All information is as accurate as I can find doing ONLINE research. I assume some of the connections probably break down under intense scrutiny, but combining Find a Grave, wikitree, and more - I'm at least having fun with this. I am not making anything up myself, if information is incorrect -- my sources are incorrect.


Notes:
